All source code in this repo should not be used in production. This is for development purpose only. Feel free to clone/fork the repo and modify as expected. 

## Overview

A simple microservice application using REST, SOAP and Webhooks. The SOAP server is written in PHP, allowing you call procedures remotely. JSON is used over XML for simplicity. REST is done through Python Flask API, which is also responsible for handling webhook requests and talking to React via WebSocket or API calls.
